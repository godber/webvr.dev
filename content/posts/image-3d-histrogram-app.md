I have been playing around with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for a few weeks
trying to build 3D Image Histogram App.  It finally has all of the necessary
basic functionality and you can see the latest version of it here:

https://xr.webvr.dev/ex/three.js/points2/ex7.html

What this does is it takes and input image (selected from the dropdown or drag
and dropped onto the browser window), walks through that image pixel by pixel
and counts all of the R, G, B triplets up and displays those counts in 3D where
the axes correspond to R, G and B.
