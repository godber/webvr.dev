On December 7th, 2021 I gave an Intro to WebXR Presentation to the
[Phoenix VR for Good](https://www.meetup.com/Phoenix-VR-For-Good-Meetup/) group.
This presentation describes the Web APIs that make XR possible on the web.  It
touches on the existing technologies that simplify development of WebXR
applications and shares two example applications from [`three.js`](https://threejs.org)
and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).
